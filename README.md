# Bayesian spatial smoothing methods to produce ADM2 level estimates from HCES data

In this repository I will apply bayesian spatial smoothing methods to produce more reliable ADM2 level estimates from HCES data. In this particular case study I will use the Nigeria Living Standards Survey (NLSS) 2018-19, to estimate risk of inadequate vitamin B12 intake from the diet. The NLSS is designed to be representative only down to the ADM1 level, therefore estimates that are generated for finer spatial resolutions are likely to be unstable and sensitive to outliers. To solve this problem, I will apply bayesian spatial smoothing models such as the Besag-York-Molli√© (BYM) model to reduce the instability of estimates by smoothing estimates both locally and globally in space.
